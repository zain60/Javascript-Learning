A stream is a Sequance of data that moves from one postion to other overtime

-> NOde js can t control the pace in which data is arriving in streams,
data can be too low
data can b more then capacity at time
node maintain a space/memnory in runtime to process stream of data this waiting area is called buffer
BUffers have very limited memory
