In javascript functions are first class objects
we can return function as value from a function
we can pass them as argummets to a function

//    ********************* Call Back function  *********************//

any function that is passed as an argument to another function is called callback function

//    ********************* Higher order function  *********************//

any function that accepts a function as argumnt or return a function is called Higher order function

//    ********************* TYpes of call back function  *********************//

    1-----------> Synchrononous callbacks : A callback that is executed imediately  
    2-----------> ASynchrononous callback :  A call back used to resume/contine code execution after a  async oferation is complaeted
    used to delay execution of a function untill a specfic time/event occurs
